#Motivation for this project
My website used to be run off wordpress since before I knew how to program, and the whole thing was a bit overgrown, cluttered and hard to control. Also, I had a bunch of spare time on a cruise with no internet and really wanted a project to occupy myself. Hence this codebase was born!
My design goals for this was to have something that, from an authors perspective, was dead simple to use. Like I want to create a single markdown file with just the body of a page and have it automatically add the rest of the website around it.
In keeping with the goal of trying to keep this as simple as possible, this means no server side scripting or database for now. I'm trying to only add complexity as I need it. Therefore, all the content of the website is statically generated. Static HTML generators have probably been done a zillion times before, but its always feels nice to make something yourself and use your own tools.
