This is the code that will eventually run stonelinks.org, my personal website. It's been run off wordpress since before i knew how to program, and the whole thing is a bit overgrown, cluttered and hard to control. Also, I'm on a cruise right now without internet and really want something to occupy myself.

I want something that is simple, easy to manage and easy to add whatever content i feel like. I have some additional design goals, they are in docs/plan.md for now.

Basically trying to keep this as simple as possible. This means no server side scripting or database for now. I'm trying to only add complexity as i need it.

All this does at the moment is compile markdown files and add some html and css for navigation and to make it look nice. This kind of thing has probably been done a zillion times before, but I wanted to make one myself.
