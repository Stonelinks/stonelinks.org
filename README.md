This is the code that runs stonelinks.org, my personal website. It is also a standalone html compiler for trees of markdown files. This means that if you want a website, all you need to do is:
- Write the body of your web pages in markdown files
- Put them in the `content` directory either alone or put related files a directory
- Change some simple settings in config.py
- Modify the makefile to deploy to your webserver of choice
- Run `make site`
- ????
- Profit
If you want to see what the end result from this system looks like, check out [my website](http://stonelinks.org).
