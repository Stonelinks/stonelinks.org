I am applying to work for the Design Lab at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute for the spring semester of
2012. My relevant and diverse experience establishes me as a top tier candidate for any of the projects
in the MDL.

Over the past three years, I have accrued many technical skills generally concentrated in the areas of
robotics, manufacturing and automation, computer and web programming. I spent the first two years of
my college career employed at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. There I designed and
programmed experimental procedures and equipment to prototype X-ray telescope optics. This
involved hands on experience with things like embedded control, programming, manufacturing
automation, motion control and electrical/mechanical hardware design. It has been an incredible job,
and I have gained a lot of valuable technical and interpersonal experience, as well as sharpened my
analytical problem solving skills.

This past summer, I interned at a small startup called Anybots, a web-based robotics telepresence
company out in Mountain View, CA. At Anybots, I did everything from work on firmware for the
touchscreen in the forehead to writing user interface code. However, my greatest accomplishment there
was writing a tool to pull logs off our fleet of robots and statistically track, diagnose and analyze
potential bugs and errors. This tool enabled engineers and QA to prioritize bugfixes and contact users
whose robots were not functioning optimally.

I have been involved with robots in some way, shape or form for more than half my life. I find them to
be interesting, challenging and rewarding applications of technology that stand to revolutionize the way
we live our lives. I hope that the Design Lab can assist me in along my road to development as a
professional engineer ready to make meaningful change and progress in robotics technology in
tomorrow's world.
