Prelim:

Small wall-hanging chalk board 
    - Divided down the center with two sections 
        - (in->left and out->right)
    - 3 Columns in each section
        - who, what, when
    - Several rows of blank lines underneath

Don't things like this already exist? how would this be different?<hr>

<b>Guest at 2010-03-22 06:48:38:</b><br /><br />These probably do exist. I was just frustrated by Mandrews's inability to return anything, came up with the idea, and pictured it in the pages of Good Housekeeping. Not necessarily different, but cheap and marketable.<hr>
