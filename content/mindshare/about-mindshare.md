#About Mindshare

##What was Mindshare?

Mindshare was an idea I had awhile back as a means of sharing and recording ideas with a friend of mine. Oftentimes I find that some ideas are far fetched or out of a particular project's scope. These ideas are not necessarily bad, just not useful at the time. I thought it would be good to record ideas like this for later reference, and even cooler to share them with other people who might read them and maybe respond or share some of their own.

##Where did it go?

Unfortunately Mindshare is no longer active. It died when I switched stonelinks off wordpress and to the current structure. If there is enough interst, maybe I'll bring it back.
