...that is biodegradable, disposable, and cheap but doesn't fall apart in the rain. Could be printed cheaply with company logos or given out at "green" events.<hr>

could be waterproofed by depositing a layer of wax on the side in contact with the rain, similar to a dixie cup. How would it fold (if at all) or would the user simply throw it out after it stops raining?<hr>

If the cardboard/paper is thin or pliable enough, it will fold itself (like those paper drink umbrellas). No?
