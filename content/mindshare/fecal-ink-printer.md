#Fecal Ink Printer

A printer that draws its ink source from fecal matter. I hate paying for Ink because it is really expensive. Oftentimes, it is actually cheaper to buy a whole new printer with ink already in it. This is annoying, and like most I find annoying, it got me thinking of ways to eliminate the problem.

Somehow I got on the train of thought that went something along the lines of "whats cheaper than poop?"

I'm sure there are a million possible criticisms to this idea, but right now I have no reason to think that they could not be overcome.

The health risks are the most obvious. The fecal matter would somehow have to be refined by the printer so that things printed by this machine met some acceptable standards.

The color of the ink and how well the ink adheres to the paper is of concern as well. I was thinking of somehow baking or burning the feces prior to a print job. This would both char the feces to be black as well as kill most bacteria.

Now that i think of it, the problem doesn't really lie in the printer, but the ink.

Any more ideas on how to make feces-derived ink feasible? Would a special printer head need to be designed or could the hypothetical ink be printed with a standard print head?
