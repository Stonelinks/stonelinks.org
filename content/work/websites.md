#Websites

<strong>Intro</strong>

I make websites. It started out as a hobby -- sometime around my senior year in high school I started questioning how the internet works. This lead to me discovering what a web server was. Fast forward to today and you can see that the whole thing has snowballed to the point where a fair amount of my time and brainpower goes into making websites.

Whenever possible, I try to use existing solutions instead of wasting my time doing everything from scratch. To this end, most of my website work (including Stonelinks) is done with the aid of the Wordpress core. Briefly, Wordpress started out as a blogging platform, however it is such a versatile tool that it can be used like a CMS. I have fooled around with "real" CMS like Drupal but found the whole experience to be completely non-intuitive (that being said, it was awhile ago and I know more now so perhaps I should give it a second chance).

Wordpress has many advantages, but if I had to name the biggest one, it would be that it lets my clients edit the contents of their websites without having to go back and forth with me. This being said, Wordpress isn't always desirable or practical, and I still make and maintain sites that do not use it.

<strong>Clients</strong>

My schedule is very full right now with classes, writing documentation from my work over the summer, and with existing clients (namely Dr. Lakshmi and the Baruch Center). Therefore I'd be hesitant to bring on any new clients. That being said, if for some reason you really need / want me, <a href="http://stonelinks.org/luke/contact">here is how to contact me</a>.
