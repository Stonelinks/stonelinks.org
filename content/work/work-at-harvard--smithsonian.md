##Overview

For the past two and a half years I have designed experimental equipment and written software to prototype X-ray telescope optics at the [Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics](http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/hea/). During my time there I have gained a ton of priceless technical experience, as well as sharpened my analytical problem solving and interpersonal communication skills.

Part of my time there has been spent writing a software suite to automate the complex task of creating an optic given specific geometry, thicknesses, and other parameters. Along the journey of implementing this software, I have had to develop user interfaces, control sequences, hardware monitors, error checkers and motion control algorithms. One of the most challenging parts has been the program's organization. As the complexity of the programs have increased, I've reworked the architecture several times to increase efficiency, eliminate inefficient code, and ultimately make it much tighter, portable and friendly for users and developers. The utilities I wrote also allow me to monitor and control chamber hardware without being physically present in the lab (extremely valuable for troubleshooting from several states away).

Another significant part of my time at Harvard has been designing and assembling both mechanical and electrical components that have been incorporated into our production chambers. Specifically this has entailed using CAD to design and virtually prototype hardware, working closely with stepper motors, drivers, motion controllers as well as developing a custom solenoid controller that is both cheap and high performance. Of course all the hardware had to come from somewhere, so I also worked closely with vendors to source and buy these components. The most rewarding part of hardware has been watching something that I had designed on a computer come to life in the real world.

Other random things I have done in the lab include the repair of a very expensive profile-meter (used for characterizing optic substrates), as well as the supervision and guidance of a high school student in conducting characterizations on the very same instrument. Ultimately the end result of all my time at Harvard has been the creation of a robust and easy to use system that makes the daunting task of producing any kind of X-ray optic as easy and stress free as possible for someone not intimately familiar with the details. Hopefully if NASA ever gets enough funding, my tools will end up creating something that ends up in space!

##More details about Multilayer Fabrication Software

I have had the distinct pleasure of working with Dr. Suzanne Romaine and Ricardo Bruni integrating hardware and writing software that automates the fabrication and production of multilayer (and sometimes non-multilayer) coatings deposited on the surfaces of optics and test optics to be used in x-ray astronomy. These multilayer coatings are designed to capture, focus and reflect the x-ray photons from deep space back on to an array of detectors inside of the telescope to form an image. The coatings are called "multilayers" because they consist of very thin (sometimes only a couple of angstroms) alternating layers of different materials.

The software I have written works off a list of desired layer thicknesses. The user can either use the program to generate constant thicknesses itself, or alternatively can choose to import a list of thicknesses generated by another program (such as thicknesses generated from a program in [IDL](http://www.ittvis.com/ProductServices/IDL.aspx)). The user then inputs a few other parameters, such as the number of layers and the material deposition rates. Once all the pre-run parameters are entered, the program generates a set of instructions for itself to follow during the run. All input and instructions are checked for potential errors, and if everything checks out the user can start the run.

The technique used to actually coat the optic is called DC magnetron sputtering. A website explaining the basics can be found [here](http://www.ajaint.com/whatis.htm). This technique, in combination with other constraints for the multilayer dictate the following basic requirements:

- The coating is conducted in a vacuum chamber
- Deposition of two component materials need to be precisely controlled
- Position of optic is mobile and precisely controlled inside the chamber
- Able to move between the two sources

Additionally, the deposition sources (magnetrons, also called the cathodes) are always on during a run, can only deposit one material at a fixed rate, and only cover a small portion of the total surface on the optic to be coated. Therefore, I have written control algorithms to determine how to move equipment inside the chamber to properly and accurately coat the optic. The basic equipment the software deals with to achieve this level of control are:

- A four axis stepper motor controller in the PC (instructions are issued to it by the software)
- A stepper motor attached to the platen, used for angular positioning of the optic
- Two shutters to control the deposition of their respective magnetrons
- An optional mandrel (also controlled VIA a stepper) to add an extra dimension to coatings (IE coat a cylindrical optic as opposed to a flat wafer)
- Two stepper motor drivers for the platen and mandrel
- Assorted power supplies

Once a run is started, the user sits back and monitors the chamber and magnetron conditions while the coating is executed. Multilayers can be several hundred angstroms thick and deposition rates small, so its not rare that runs last several hours. In the event of an emergency or if something needs to be re-adjusted, the user can choose to abort or pause a run. While paused or not in a run, a full suite of tools to manually control and re-align the chamber are available. At all times, the user has graphical feedback as to the current status of the chamber, as well as how far along the run has progressed.

#Other work I have done

Further work I've done includes unifying all versions of of the software for all the different chambers / optic geometries, designing chamber hardware from CAD, to ordering fabrication of parts through machinists, chamber assembly, supervising a high school student, fixing a $70,000 profile-meter, decrease shutter latency by designing a money saving part, the list goes on.
