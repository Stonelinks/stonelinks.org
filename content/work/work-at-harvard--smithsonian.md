At the <a href="http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/hea/">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</a>, I have the distinct pleasure of working with Dr. Suzanne Romaine and Ricardo Bruni integrating hardware and writing software that automates the fabrication and production of multilayer (and sometimes non-multilayer) coatings deposited on the surfaces of optics and test optics to be used in x-ray astronomy.

These multilayer coatings are designed to capture, focus and reflect the x-ray photons from deep space back on to an array of detectors inside of the telescope to form an image. The coatings are called "multilayers" because they consist of very thin (sometimes only a couple of angstroms) alternating layers of different materials.
<h3><strong>Automation Software Overview</strong></h3>
The software I have written works off a list of desired layer thicknesses. The user can either use the program to generate constant thicknesses itself, or alternatively can choose to import a list of thicknesses generated by another program (such as thicknesses generated from a program in <a href="http://www.ittvis.com/ProductServices/IDL.aspx">IDL</a>). The user then inputs a few other parameters, such as the number of layers and the material deposition rates. Once all the pre-run parameters are entered, the program generates a set of instructions for itself to follow during the run. All input and instructions are checked for potential errors, and if everything checks out the user can start the run.

The technique used to actually coat the optic is called DC magnetron sputtering. A website explaining the basics can be found <a href="http://www.ajaint.com/whatis.htm">here</a>. This technique, in combination with other constraints for the multilayer dictate the following basic requirements:
<ul>
	<li>The coating is conducted in a vacuum chamber</li>
	<li>Deposition of two component materials need to be precisely controlled</li>
	<li>Position of optic is mobile and precisely controlled inside the chamber</li>
	<li>Able to move between the two sources</li>
</ul>
Additionally, the deposition sources (magnetrons, also called the cathodes) are always on during a run, can only deposit one material at a fixed rate, and only cover a small portion of the total surface on the optic to be coated. Therefore, sophisticated control algorithms are at work to determine how to move equipment inside the chamber to properly and accurately coat the optic. The basic equipment the software deals with to achieve this level of control are:
<ul>
	<li>A four axis stepper motor controller in the PC (instructions are issued to it by the software)</li>
	<li>A stepper motor attached to the platen, used for angular positioning of the optic</li>
	<li>Two shutters to control the deposition of their respective magnetrons</li>
	<li>An optional mandrel (also controlled VIA a stepper) to add an extra dimension to coatings (IE coat a cylindrical optic as opposed to a flat wafer)</li>
	<li>Two stepper motor drivers for the platen and mandrel</li>
	<li>Assorted power supplies</li>
</ul>
Once a run is started, the user sits back and monitors the chamber and magnetron conditions while the coating is executed. Multilayers can be several hundred angstroms thick and deposition rates small, so its not rare that runs last several hours. In the event of an emergency or if something needs to be re-adjusted, the user can choose to abort or pause a run. While paused or not in a run, a full suite of tools to manually control and re-align the chamber are available. At all times, the user has graphical feedback as to the current status of the chamber, as well as how far along the run has progressed.
<h3><strong>Work I have done</strong></h3>
Further work I've done includes unifying all versions of of the software for all the different chambers / optic geometries, designing chamber hardware from CAD, to ordering fabrication of parts through machinists, chamber assembly, supervising a high school student, fixing a $70,000 profile-meter, decrease shutter latency by designing a money saving part, the list goes on. Unfortunately Suzanne wanted me to stop working on the documentation I was doing. A half finished version of documentation is available <a href="http://stonelinks.org/luke/Dropbox/CfA/documentation/Main_Format.pdf">here</a> for those that are curious.
