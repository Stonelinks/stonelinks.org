#Anybots Hello Anybots!

My name is Lucas Doyle and I would like to express my interest in working for you over the summer. As per [the recommendation](http://twitter.com/
#!/trustyfedora/status/37230175347277824) of Ray Sampson, I am sending my resume along with a list of projects I have worked on. I'll keep this brief, but a bit about myself. I am a Junior Computer and Systems Engineering student at RPI that currently works for the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics as well as a self-employed web developer with a strong passion for robotics. I have experience with things like embedded control, web programming, manufacturing automation, motion control, electrical/mechanical hardware design and of course robotics! As you can tell from the list below, I have been involved with robots for more than half my life and find them to be interesting, challenging and rewarding applications of technology. So without further ado, the list:

##Automated Multilayer Fabrication - Freshman year (2009 - Present)

For the past two and a half years I have designed experimental equipment to prototype X-ray telescope optics at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. It has been an awesome job, and I have gained a lot of valuable technical and interpersonal experience, as well as sharpened my analytical problem solving skills. Part of my time there has been spent writing a software suite to automate the complex task of creating an optic given specific geometry, thicknesses, and other parameters. Along the journey of implementing this software, I have had to develop user interfaces, control sequences, hardware monitors, error checkers and motion control algorithms. One of the most challenging parts has been the program's organization. As the complexity of the programs have increased, I've reworked the architecture several times to increase efficiency, eliminate redundancies and ultimately make it much tighter, portable and programmer friendly. The utilities I wrote also allow me to monitor and control chamber hardware without being physically present in the lab. Another significant part of my time at Harvard has been designing and assembling both mechanical and electrical components that have been incorporated into our chambers. Specifically this has entailed using CAD to design and virtually prototype hardware (pictured above), working closely with stepper motors, drivers and controllers as well as developing a custom solenoid controller that is both cheap and high performance. Of course all the hardware had to come from somewhere, so I also worked closely with vendors to source and buy these components. The most rewarding part of hardware has been watching something that I had designed on a computer come to life. Other random things I have done in the lab include the repair of a very expensive profile-meter, as well as the supervision and guidance of a high school student in conducting optic characterizations on the very same instrument. Ultimately the end result of all my time at Harvard has been the creation of a robust and easy to use system that makes the daunting task of producing any kind of X-ray optic as easy and stress free as possible for someone not intimately familiar with the details. Hopefully if NASA ever gets enough funding, my tools will end up creating something that ends up in space!

##IED Border Patrol Robot - Sophomore year (2010)

Despite its shortcomings, this remains as one of the best builds I have been a part of. This robot went from being an idea, to a concept, design and to implementation in six short weeks in response to an open ended project for a "GPS robotic platform" sponsored by Lockheed Martin. Our chosen application was the remote detection of illegal immigrants, the idea being that with enough of these robots, one border patrol agent has eyes in many places, is taken out of harms way, and can use aggregated GPS data to track trends, such as where are the most immigrants coming from. On one hand, this project was a failure as we totally failed to produce a mechanically sound robot that could drive around and do what we wanted. On the other hand, I got to write some amazing software to control this thing from the internet, write NMEA parsers for the GPS, discover MJPG video streaming, work with the Google maps API, etc. More importantly, I also learned a ton about how a team can break down, how to think about design problems in terms of what a customer wants, how to conduct research and benchmarking against similar products, how to lead a group, how to present things to a non-technical customer (that one was fun! I couldn't talk about programming at all in the final presentation) and make efficient technical decisions with a deadline in mind. Probably the most frustrating thing about this robot was that despite having five of our seven team members on mechanical, the only thing that didn't work were the mechanics. It was the kind of team dynamic where two team members (Matt Williamson and I... Matt deserves a medal for his work on the electrical system) made up for everyone else's lack of experience or slacking off in the end. Matt and I basically ended up writing most of the 137 page [technical report]({{wr}}luke/School/College/ENGR%202050/IED%20Design%20Project/Final%20Report/IED_tech_report_final.pdf). Overall I had a blast with it, and it remains a robot I am very proud of. Gallery of pictures [here]({{wr}}?page_id=993).

##Litec Blimp - Sophomore year (2010)

The Litec blimp was the final project for an embedded control class I took at the end of my Sophomore year. While the blimp hardware was provided, the majority of the challenge was becoming familiar enough with the Intel 8051 microcontroller architecture to implement things like PID control, I2C, SPI, PWM, interrupts, analog to digital conversion, etc. The ultimate goal of the blimp was to be able to autonomously hold a specified altitude and heading. More than anything, working with the 8051 made me appreciate how much is being automatically taken care of when working with something like an Arduino. A formal report by the lab group my lab partners and I wrote dealing with the blimp can be found [here]({{wr}}luke/School/College/ENGR%202530%20-%2003/reports/blimp%20report/final.pdf).

##Battlebot - Sophomore year (2009 - early 2010)

Unfortunately I went through the trouble of designing most of this robot on my own for a now dissolved group of students at RPI interested in Battlebots. It never made it into the real world but still remains a viable design as far as I am concerned. A lot written about it [here]({{wr}}?page_id=202).

##Personal robot - Freshman year (2008 - onwards)

This robot at first wasn't even really a robot, just some servos, a pan tilt module and an Arduino. However, just like my personal website, it has had many incarnations over the years and exists primary as an educational tool for me to learn more about robotics. Over the years it has been controlled from windows, linux, LabVIEW, locally, from the internet, or completely without a PC at all. It used to be attached to a netbook and some wheels, and I used to drive it around the dorm and talk to people using text to speech. In its current incarnation, it is attached to a small [industrial PC](http://www.fit-pc.com/web/) and has functioned mostly as a stationary observer, though I have plans to start using it for image recognition. I have already started implementing this by using it to teach myself Python. I also don't really have a good picture for it as it is always changing.

##FIRST Robotics - High School senior year (2008)

This was basically 2007's FIRST design, part two. The competition was [Overdrive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRST_Overdrive), which was essentially a race with large balls in the track that optionally accumulate points. As captain, I wanted to steer the team in the direction of "do one thing and do it well" and essentially wanted to design a dragster type robot to make laps as fast as possible. However, part of working as a team is accepting other people's ideas even when you don't necessarily agree with them. The team went with mechanum wheels again, and we lost sight of what we were originally trying to do (heard the ball). Still, I tried to make the best of it and designed a completely modular chassis for the wheels, whereby one standard "box" design (included a speed controller, wheel, bearings, pillow blocks, etc) could be iterated four times and bolted together. This saved design time, simplified troubleshooting and made it a breeze to replace parts. Another interesting side effect of this design -- I learned how to properly weld aluminum (there were a TON of joints), which is quite tricky. All in all our team had really perfected the mechanum drive train, so it was not a total loss. Also, this particular year I did not do any nordic skiing for the school, as I contributed much of the programming as well as work on the electrical system of the robot on top of my usual help with the CAD and machining of the drive train.

##AI Autonomous Boat - High School junior summer (2007)

One of the best summers of my life was spent in Concord NH at the St. Paul's Advanced Studies Program taking a grad level AI class with other talented and like minded students from around NH. We spent the summer learning things like game theory, programming in LISP, finite state automata, building simple robots, etc. The culmination however occurred when the whole class pulled together and tried to design an autonomous boat around a FIRST controller, some 8020, and old sailboat hull and trolling motor. I was in charge of the steering system, which failed terrifically as I was not allowed to modify the trolling motor in any way so I tried to do it with rope (didn't work). As you can see from the picture (I did a lot of running that summer and was basically a twig) the class also elected me to be the "test pilot". Nothing like being in an old sail boat hull filled with electronics (those cold cathode lights were high voltage too!) surrounded by water.

##FIRST Robotics - High School junior year (2007)

As is probably evident from that video, this robot represented our team's first foray into the world of [mechanum wheels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecanum_wheel). For the next two years, I would help design mechanum drive trains for our team (CAD mostly). While cool, unfortunately our teams obsession over the wheels would cause us to lose sight of the arm attachment that would need to sit on to perform the robot's function of removing tubes from the rack for 2007's [Rack 'n Roll](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rack_'n_Roll) competition.

##FIRST Robotics - High School sophomore year (2006)

This was the first year our school had a First Robotics team, and our rookie team's entry into the [Aim High](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aim_High) competition. It was and still is a relatively unsophisticated beast of a robot that could drive full tilt into a brick wall and still work. Fundamentally, its function was to pick up, store, and then shoot foam balls. Sadly this was so long ago (5 years as of writing this... I feel old) that I don't specifically remember many of the details about it.

##The RCX Lego Programmable Brick - 4th grade (\~1999)

I very well may owe all of my inspiration to pursue robotics to that silly yellow brick pictured above. I used to (and most likely still do -- I used this all through high school) love playing with Legos. The pinnacle of any Lego set I have ever received has got to be the Robotics Invention System. Thank god for my generous and understanding parents for not laughing me out of the room when the 4th grade version of me wanted this $200 kit (I'm not spoiled, they made me work for it, don't worry). Just writing about it makes me want to jump out of this chair, run down to the basement and pull it out and start building. I cannot tell you the hours I spent building and programming (though mostly building) this thing. More than any other robot on this list, the RCX played a pivotal role in who I am as an engineer and future roboticist.

* * * * *

This concludes the list. I realize it is long, but thank you for reading it! I'd like to close by saying that from what I have seen of Anybots, from both an engineer and a consumer's perspective, I am very impressed with your telepresence robots. Feel free to contact me or let me know if I can provide references for you. Again thank you for your time and consideration and I'd love to be a part of your team!
