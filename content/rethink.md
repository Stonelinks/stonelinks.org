Dear Rethink,

I am writing in response to the opening for Software Engineer.

I can offer you four years of experience as a programmer and engineer who has worked extensively within the domains of robotics and automation. I have experience writing software for motion control at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, authoring a collaborative robot planning and simulation framework for Boeing and implementing a robot inventory and bug tracking program at Anybots. As a recent Computer Engineering graduate from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, it is my plan to start a lifelong career in robotics. Beyond my technical skills I have an immense passion and pride for my work, a focus for making a product that end-users want, and an inquisitive mind that is constantly inventing, experimenting and learning.

I also understand that there is an opening on your website for Senior Developer Relations Engineer. While I doubt I have the experience for a senior position, I would definitely like to help out with the position's responsibilities. In my [projects](http://stonelinks.org/projects/index.html) I've used many different libraries, platforms, SDKs and APIs. Some of them have great examples and documentation ([OpenRAVE](http://openrave.org/docs/latest_stable/) has got to be the best), however many (sadly) leave much to be desired. More often than not, the product itself is fine, but there is a lack of quality communication with developers.

Rethink has the exciting potential to put robots in the hands of researchers, developers and average people that will do new and amazing things that Rethink might never have conceived. For other companies, this unknown and uncertainty could make them opt to keep their platform closed. Rethink isn't that kind of company, and instead has the wisdom to empower its customers and embrace the developer community with an open platform/SDK. I have tremendous respect for that decision, and want to be a part of making your platform a great one.

A manufacturing robot that could be taught tasks by an average person and operate in an unstructured environment would be revolutionary. I'm really interested in Rethink, and excited for the future that robots have in our lives. Helping to make that future a reality is something I would like to be a part of at Rethink.

My resume is available [here](http://stonelinks.org/luke/resume.html) and I would welcome the chance to speak with you.

Sincerely,

Lucas Doyle
