##Features

Some highlights of the system are:

- Present all information in an intuitive manner through a web interface
- Automatically sent daily global fleet status emails to engineering team
- Used google APIs to store data in existing google docs spreadsheets and generate attractive charts
- Kept track of "deltas" for all robots (e.g if a robot was online yesterday and offline today, we would be notified)
- Maintained various rankings for most healthy robots, sickest robots, robots with a specific error, etc.
