The incentive and best application I can think of for this is to produce solo cups and ping pong balls out of the reclaimed plastic. Such a device would cut down on wasted plastic and excess waste at many college campuses across the country and provide fraternities and sororities (or any other similar organization) with \'free\' supplies to play that oh-so-popular college drinking game.{{field}}0{{field}}2010-03-22 04:18:56{{field}}1{{field}}Waste Based Plastic Moulding{{field}}0{{field}}2{{line}}4{{field}}A printer that draws its ink source from fecal matter. I hate paying for Ink because it is really expensive. Oftentimes, it is actually cheaper to buy a whole new printer with ink already in it. This is annoying, and like most I find annoying, it got me thinking of ways to eliminate the problem.

Somehow I got on the train of thought that went something along the lines of \"whats cheaper than poop?\"

I\'m sure there are a million possible criticisms to this idea, but right now I have no reason to think that they could not be overcome.

The health risks are the most obvious. The fecal matter would somehow have to be refined by the printer so that things printed by this machine met some acceptable standards.

The color of the ink and how well the ink adheres to the paper is of concern as well. I was thinking of somehow baking or burning the feces prior to a print job. This would both char the feces to be black as well as kill most bacteria.

Now that i think of it, the problem doesn\'t really lie in the printer, but the ink.

Any more ideas on how to make feces-derived ink feasible? Would a special printer head need to be designed or could the hypothetical ink be printed with a standard print head?{{field}}0{{field}}2010-03-22 04:26:56{{field}}1{{field}}Fecal Ink Printer{{field}}0{{field}}3{{line}}6{{field}}Every year people and machines fall through the ice on ponds and lakes. The side effects misjudgment of of ice thickness can be anything from hypothermia, loss of an expensive piece of equipment, or even death.

If a robot were made to autonomously monitor and display the thickness of ice on a body of water, it very well could help avoid these kinds of situations.

The robot would have to be able to withstand the elements and traverse the terrain normally encountered on a frozen body of water. It could use GPS data / google maps to navigate the frozen body of water, gauge ice thickness, and report back to some kind of server if the ice is safe or not.

The key to everything is the bots ability to accurately determine the thickness of the ice. This could be done with ultrasound or with a small drill.

The approach I favor most is the drill due to my immediate ease of understanding. Basically the robot would drill a hole in the ice and lower a probe with exposed contacts on the end. If the probe hits water, the circuit completes and the robot records the depth of the probe. If the depth is less than what a human could stand, then the ice is not safe.{{field}}0{{field}}2010-03-22 04:41:07{{field}}1{{field}}Ice Thickness Robot{{field}}0{{field}}5{{line}}7{{field}}WebApp

The way I see getting this done, at least for phones, is writing several separate platform specific applications (one for windows phone, android, iphone, webOS, blackberry, etc) that function as an abstraction layer. This, while potentially cantankerous, monstrously inefficient, limited or all of the above, would be designed to provide the would-be application programmer a standard instruction set available across all platforms. One could then do the same thing but on a computer and bingo, the app is running on something other than a phone.

I actually hate the whole morning routine in its entirety, but by far the most time consuming thing (and, therefore the \'bottleneck\' of me getting out the door) in the morning is the shower.

In my mind, I take showers for one reason only: so I\'m not filthy and smell like a pile of garbage, scare off women (though I do that anyway) get sick and die because of my poor hygiene. Some people derive pleasure from their showers, and I\'m not saying I don\'t derive some form of pleasure from covering my body with mildly scalding water as well. What I\'m trying to say here is that I would trade the pleasure I get from taking a shower for time savings in the morning. There are 6,692,030,277 people on earth, and I can\'t be the only person out there who feels this way.

Down to my idea: What does all the hot water and soap encountered in the shower actually do? It kills the \'bad\' germs.

Enter what I\'d like to call the shower field generator. This would be a device, installed in a bathroom doorway or someplace similar, that a user could strip down, walk through, and receive the same eradication of germs as you would from a normal shower.

If such a device could actually be implemented, it would have many, many applications beyond the just home. Imagine a hospital where nurses do not have to sponge down patients who cant move from their beds. They could just lie there with no clothes on in the hospital bed and make two passes under the field emitter (one face up, the other face down). Imagine being able to contain diseases by using these things as doors, etc. Applications don\'t even need to be on humans. Put one of these bad boys on a road, and you have an instant carwash.

I don\'t even have the faintest idea about how one would go about implementing this. I know that for it to be viable, it must preserve the body\'s naturally occurring germs, which would make targeting the bad germs particularly difficult.  {{field}}0{{field}}2010-03-26 06:35:23{{field}}1{{field}}The \"Shower\" Field Generator{{field}}0{{field}}19{{line}}41{{field}}Love the home locator idea with a twist.

Data would be provided by industrial development agencies and commercial real estate brokers   

I also would twist this to allow tourists to download an itinerary of things they would like to see. Data would be  posted to a tourism website. Something like Tripit but with a focus on what to see not where to stay.

The main thing I am interested in is how to get good control over the robot VIA the internet. With my experience so far, I am mostly used to having the robot automatically connect to a wireless network. So far things have worked out pretty well because I\'ve been on college campuses where one giant network usually blankets an area that the robot operates in.

I\'d like to develop a system that gets around this for the robot. Basically, as the robot drives through the city it updates it\'s IP address based on which wifi networks it can access.

[b]How it will access networks:[/b]

Walking around an area like Cambridge and looking at the numerous networks, it is easy to see that they all have varying degrees of security. For the spirit of this project i\'m going to avoid using the harvard wireless network as much as possible.

Connection logic:

For each wireless connection successfully made (i\'ll define \'successful\' as able to send and receive HTTP), the robot must do the following:

[list]

[*]Forward the relevant ports (namely port 80, maybe 22 for SSH, maybe some other port for a webcam stream) to itself on the router (using UPnP probably). This is not necessary when the connection metric of the wireless interface is 0 (meaning that the robot is connected directly to the internet). This is easy to test for in linux. 

[*]Register the WAN IP of the router with some DNS server so that I can go to a domain and control the thing despite the ever-changing IP address as it drives out of range in one network. The annoying thing is that DNS servers are usually slow (ttl is usually like 60 seconds) which means that there will be delays between each network change that will be as long as it takes to successfully connect, and then contact the DNS server.
[/list]

Now for the connection logic itself. The key problem being solved here is how to automatically and forcefully connect to a wireless network. We are making assumptions about these networks: That they are sufficiently dense such that some are left unsecured or partially secured and are therefore able to be used by the robot. We are also assuming the network topology is random. This means that every time the robot goes out of range on a network that was working for it, it needs to re-figure everything out to establish a new reliable connection. This means that some kind of decision making priority structure needs to be established (calling that the connection logic). For example, the best case scenario (and therefore the first thing the robot would test for when making a networt hop) would be an unsecured network with high signal strength. The worst case scenario (and lowest on the priority) is that it cannot find anything to use and therefore must reconnect to and remain in the old networks range.

[b]Actions after a network hop is to be made:[/b]
[list]

[*]An unsecured wireless network with a decent signal strength exists within the vicinity of the robot. Connect to it, attempt to establish internet connection. Forward the appropriate ports. If two way traffic is accomplished, then update the DNS with the current IP and quit (successful).
[*]If above fails at any point, try to find a network in range with decent signal strength that is secured with WEP. Attempt to crack this with aircrack. If successfully cracked, again attempt to establish internet connection. Forward the appropriate ports. If two way traffic is accomplished, then update the DNS with the current IP and quit (successful).
[*]If above fails, reconnect to the old network and notify the user that the hop was unsuccessful
[/list]

The robot should probably aggregate information in a database as it goes along. Things like network names, types, locations (GPS?) would be useful. Considerations also need to be made for bandwidth usage. We want the UI to be useful but not wasteful. Upstream speeds on most home modems are pitifully low. Last, this may seem like solving a problem that does not exist because you could get around all of this by using 3g. My answer to that is that I don\'t want to pay for a data plan and have to worry about tethering and whatnot. Besides with 3g you lack anonymity. The ever-changing IP address model ensures that the robot is using other peoples IP address to connect and can\'t easily be traced back to someone. Besides this whole thing is a very good exercise in automation, linux, and networking protocols.

It is undoubtedly a huge project, but I already have most of the hardware and some of the knowledge and software to do this.

Thoughts? {{field}}0{{field}}2010-06-04 06:52:03{{field}}0{{field}}City Drone{{field}}0{{field}}23{{line}}46{{field}}I should also say that if there are duplicates within type in the connection logic, it should prioritize based on signal strength.

So if these networks are in range of the robot:

[code]
SSID     Protection     Strength
foo      WEP            89%
bar      none           30%
cake     WEP            30%
ass      none           40%
burgers  WEP            50%
feet     none           50%
[/code]

It should try establishing connections in this order:
feet
ass
bar
foo
burgers
cake

Depending on how long it takes to crack WEP I might change this to prioritize based on strength instead of type of protection. Also of worth noting is that anything other than WEP or no protection will be filtered out of the potential network pool (so things like WPA, 802.1x, WPA2, etc) wont show up as well as whatever the old network was. For instance if the above networks were again in range, however the robot had just come off the \'foo\' network it would not consider it when making a new connection.

Another thing about the port forwarding. That may end up being a pain in the ass to do correctly. Maybe doing everything through UDP traffic would be better. This would, however, require major changes in the software. Part of the reason I want to do this project is because I already have software written to control the robot over a web browser. HTTP however is a TCP protocol so I would have to rewrite EVERYTHING which would not be cool.{{field}}0{{field}}2010-06-04 07:11:30{{field}}0{{field}}Re: City Drone{{field}}0{{field}}23{{line}}
