#Home Locator

Somehow parse all the houses in google streetview (say buildings in the city of cambridge for example) into some kind of map. Then, use something like the tineye API to search through user submitted queries (AKA pictures from a cellphone or something) and it could spit back an address and/or information about the place. Major problem is that the tineye API isn't free and doesn't let you add images to their index. Maybe could do something homebrew with openCV?

come to think of it i think i just described something pretty close to augmented reality.<hr>

Or Skynet perhaps.

The difficulty I foresee is that whether from the top or the front, thousands of American houses look almost exactly the same. Combined with a basic address (street or town), we might be able to narrow down the results.

Am I missing the purpose?<hr>

I don't think you are. The idea is to be able to take a picture of a building on a smartphone and have information on the building appear based on the picture contents and current GPS location.

like say i was in Rome and didn't want to go all mainstream and pay to be in with a tour group. I could be the asshole american walking around taking pictures and reading about buildings on his smartphone.

yeah.........<hr>

That'd be cool, but if you have a GPS-capable phone and a browser then there's a far simpler way to do this that would actually be pretty sick.

Take a look at Google Maps and the number of Wikipedia articles and tourist photos that have already been overlayed on common destinations (Maps>More>Photos,Wikipedia). What you should really do is use input from the phone's camera and search images tagged on Maps,etc. within a certain radius for matches. Depending on the GPS accuracy, you might not even need to go that far.

Regardless, I agree that we need more Augmented Reality apps. You should heck out Layar, which seems to be the current AR front-runner:

Love the home locator idea with a twist.  The app should reach out to multiple listing services in the area you are in download the available properties with your specification show you locations and driving directions.    For Industrial Site Selectors the app should download available commercial buildings let you drive by and then show you the interior of the structure of the space that is for rent and all the other parameters of the area. Data would be provided by industrial development agencies and commercial real estate brokers   

I also would twist this to allow tourists to download an itinerary of things they would like to see. Data would be  posted to a tourism website. Something like Tripit but with a focus on what to see not where to stay.

This may be a little plebeian for you but I have not seen it done
