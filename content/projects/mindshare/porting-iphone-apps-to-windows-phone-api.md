#Porting iPhone Apps to Windows Phone API
<hr>
<b>Guest at 2010-03-22 05:20:00:</b><br /><br />
Windows has already released the development tools for their new Windows Phone launch, though it seems they're going the standard "App" route and will start deficiently short of Apple. Is there a way, with the new iPhone, Google Phone, and Windows Phone platforms, to create a standard mobile language and then port whatever app to each one of these APIs? (vs. developing different apps in each?) A helpful analogy would be creating a universal console game IDE and then compiling for Xbox 360, PS3, etc.
