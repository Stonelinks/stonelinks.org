#Waste Based Plastic Moulding
<hr>
<b>Guest at 2010-03-22 04:18:56:</b><br /><br />The idea is to build a machine that melts down the plastic commonly found in trash or other places where large amounts of plastic (mostly cups) are thrown out, and form them into various objects.
The incentive and best application I can think of for this is to produce solo cups and ping pong balls out of the reclaimed plastic. Such a device would cut down on wasted plastic and excess waste at many college campuses across the country and provide fraternities and sororities (or any other similar organization) with 'free' supplies to play that oh-so-popular college drinking game.
