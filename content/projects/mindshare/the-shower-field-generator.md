#The "Shower" Field Generator

I hate taking showers in the morning. I actually hate the whole morning routine in its entirety, but by far the most time consuming thing (and, therefore the 'bottleneck' of me getting out the door) in the morning is the shower.

In my mind, I take showers for one reason only: so I'm not filthy and smell like a pile of garbage, scare off women (though I do that anyway) get sick and die because of my poor hygiene. Some people derive pleasure from their showers, and I'm not saying I don't derive some form of pleasure from covering my body with mildly scalding water as well. What I'm trying to say here is that I would trade the pleasure I get from taking a shower for time savings in the morning. There are 6,692,030,277 people on earth, and I can't be the only person out there who feels this way.

Down to my idea: What does all the hot water and soap encountered in the shower actually do? It kills the 'bad' germs.

Enter what I'd like to call the shower field generator. This would be a device, installed in a bathroom doorway or someplace similar, that a user could strip down, walk through, and receive the same eradication of germs as you would from a normal shower.

If such a device could actually be implemented, it would have many, many applications beyond the just home. Imagine a hospital where nurses do not have to sponge down patients who cant move from their beds. They could just lie there with no clothes on in the hospital bed and make two passes under the field emitter (one face up, the other face down). Imagine being able to contain diseases by using these things as doors, etc. Applications don't even need to be on humans. Put one of these bad boys on a road, and you have an instant carwash.

I don't even have the faintest idea about how one would go about implementing this. I know that for it to be viable, it must preserve the body's naturally occurring germs, which would make targeting the bad germs particularly difficult.
