#Auto Index for Directories

<hr>

For a number of different projects in which I reference or cite a large number of files, I wish Windows would automatically add a chronological n-digit index before the file names, simply upon saving, copying, etc. into the directory. Ex: "pic1.jpg", "anotherFile.txt" => "00 - pic1.jpg", "01 - anotherFile.txt" and so on. I'm writing a research paper with 70ish tentative sources and find it much easier to refer to them by index rather then citing them all first.

What I'm picturing: right click -> properties -> indexing

indexing(on/off)
index sub-folders(continue/new/off)

- if indexing==on
    - index string (______) // where # = number
    - ex: (## - ) or (#:) or (###)
    - start (#) //0 by default
