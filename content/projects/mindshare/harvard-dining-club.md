Harvard Dining Club
Social Club / Student Organization
Prelim:
Harvard is only a few minutes from Boston, some of the best restaurants in the nation. What prevents people from attending is not lack of money or time but lack of company. Premise - provide a social dining atmosphere, group events, get ppl together any time.
- Get UC/etc Student Life funding to eat off campus
- Rate restaurants - Privately(?)
- Website with restaurant of the month
- Restaurant Week in Boston
