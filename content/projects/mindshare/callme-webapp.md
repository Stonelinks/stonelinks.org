WebApp

Prelim:
Schedule a call by entering your number, a time, and the number you want to dial. For example, if you want to call the Florist at 9am on Friday, enter the information online, and on Friday you'll receive a call "from" the florist, which will dial the number as soon as you pick up (much like 411).

I think this would be incredibly useful. I often add "call x" to my list of things to do, and inevitably I end up putting it off or realizing that normal people don't answer phone calls at 1:00AM, and so things sometimes take longer then they should.

Would something like the link be useful in developing this?

I agree. The way Google Voice currently works, you can "dial" a number from the voice.google.com portal and it will connect whatever line you specify with the number you dialed. Perhaps there is an API for this.

See http://code.google.com/p/pygooglevoice/ and http://lmgtfy.com/?q=google+voice+api

There must be a way to do this without restricting it to another program or user account, though starting with a few services might be the way to go.
