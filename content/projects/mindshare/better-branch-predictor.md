See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor) for background.
Any novel ideas? I'm trying to come up with a new one for a final project.<hr>

Thought/read about this for a couple hours yesterday and today. It seems fascinating but very far over my head (at least in this current point in my life).
I somehow started reading about genetic algorithms. Would these have any application here? Maybe you load the processors hardware / software configuration into such a program and have it "evolve" competing architectures, complete with things like "mutation", "adaptation", "inheritance" etc. If nature has shown us anything it is that it is very capable of developing things like the brain from such rules.
