<h3><strong>IED Border Patrol Robot - Sophomore year (2010)</strong></h3>
Despite its shortcomings, this remains as one of the best builds I have been a part of. This robot went from being an idea, to a concept, design and to implementation in six short weeks in response to an open ended project for a "GPS robotic platform" sponsored by Lockheed Martin. Our chosen application was the remote detection of illegal immigrants, the idea being that with enough of these robots, one border patrol agent has eyes in many places, is taken out of harms way, and can use aggregated GPS data to track trends, such as where are most the most immigrants coming from. On one hand, this project was a failure as we totally failed to produce a mechanically sound robot that could drive around and do what we wanted. On the other hand, I got to write some amazing software to control this thing from the internet, write NMEA parsers for the GPS, discover MJPG streaming, work with the Google maps API, etc. More importantly, I also learned a ton about how a team can break down, how to think about design problems in terms of what a customer wants, how to conduct research and benchmarking against similar products, how to lead a group, how to present things to a non-technical customer (that one was fun! I couldn't talk about programming at all in the final presentation) and make efficient technical decisions with a deadline in mind. Probably the most frustrating thing about this robot was that despite having five of our seven team members on mechanical, the only thing that didn't work were the mechanics. It was the kind of team dynamic where two team members (Matt Williamson and I... Matt deserves a medal for his work on the electrical system) made up for everyone else's lack of experience or slacking off in the end. Matt and I basically ended up writing most of the 137 page <a href="http://stonelinks.org/luke/School/College/ENGR%202050/IED%20Design%20Project/Final%20Report/IED_tech_report_final.pdf">technical report</a>. Overall I had a blast with it, and it remains a robot I am very proud of. Gallery of pictures <a href="http://stonelinks.org/?page_id=993">here</a>.

<h3><strong>Litec Blimp - Sophomore year (2010)</strong></h3>
The Litec blimp was the final project for an embedded control class I took at the end of my Sophomore year. While the blimp hardware was provided, the majority of the challenge was becoming familiar enough with the Intel 8051 microcontroller architecture to implement things like PID control, I2C, SPI, PWM, interrupts, analog to digital conversion, etc. The ultimate goal of the blimp was to be able to autonomously hold a specified altitude and heading. More than anything, working with the 8051 made me appreciate how much is being automatically taken care of when working with something like an Arduino. A formal report by the lab group my lab partners and I wrote dealing with the blimp can be found <a href="http://stonelinks.org/luke/School/College/ENGR%202530%20-%2003/reports/blimp%20report/final.pdf">here</a>.

<h3><strong>Battlebot - Sophomore (2009 - early 2010)</strong></h3>
Unfortunately I went through the trouble of designing most of this robot on my own for a now dissolved group of students at RPI interested in Battlebots. It never made it into the real world but still remains a viable design as far as I am concerned. A lot written about it <a href="http://stonelinks.org/?page_id=202">here</a>.

<h3><strong>Personal robot - Freshman year at RPI (2008 - onwards)</strong></h3>
This robot at first wasn't even really a robot, just some servos, a pan tilt module and an Arduino. However, just like Stonelinks, it has had many incarnations over the years and exists primary as an educational tool for me to learn more. Over the years it has been controlled from windows, linux, Labview, locally, from the internet, to no PC at all. It used to be attached to a netbook and some wheels, and I used to drive it around the dorm and talk to people using text to speech. In its current incarnation, it has functioned mostly as a stationary observer, though I have plans to start using it for image recognition. I also don't really have a good picture for it as it is always changing.

<h3><strong>FIRST Robotics - Senior year (2008)</strong></h3>
This was basically 2007's design, part two. The competition was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRST_Overdrive">Overdrive</a>, which was essentially a race with large balls in the track that optionally accumulate points. As captain, I wanted to steer the team in the direction of "do one thing and do it well" and essentially wanted to design a dragster type robot. However, part of working as a team is accepting other people's ideas even when you don't necessarily agree with them. The team went with mechanum wheels again, and we lost sight of what we were originally trying to do (heard the ball). Still, I tried to make the best of it and designed a completely modular chassis for the wheels, whereby one standard "box" design (included a speed controller, wheel, bearings, pillow blocks, etc) could be iterated four times and bolted together. This saved design time, simplified troubleshooting and made it a breeze to replace parts. Another interesting side effect of this design -- I learned how to properly weld aluminum (there were a TON of joints), which is quite tricky. All in all our team had really perfected the mechanum drive train, so it was not a total loss. Also, this particular year I did not do any nordic skiing for the school, as I contributed much of the programming as well as work on the electrical system of the robot on top of my usual help with the CAD and machining of the drive train.

<h3><b>AI Autonomous Boat - Junior Summer (2007)</b></h3>
One of the best summers of my life was spent in Concord NH at the St. Paul's Advanced Studies Program taking a grad level AI class with Terry Wardrop and other talented and like minded students from around NH. We spent the summer learning things like game theory, programming in LISP, finite state automata, building simple robots, etc. The culmination however occurred when the whole class pulled together and tried to design an autonomous boat around a FIRST controller, some 8020, and old sailboat hull and trolling motor. I was in charge of the steering system, which failed terrifically as I was not allowed to modify the trolling motor in any way so I tried to do it with rope (didn't work). As you can see from the picture (I did a lot of running that summer and was basically a twig) the class also elected me to be the "test pilot". Nothing like being in an old sail boat hull filled with electronics (those cold cathode lights were high voltage too!) surrounded by water.

<h3><b>FIRST Robotics - Junior year of High School (2007)</b></h3>
As is probably evident from that video, this robot represented our team's first foray into the world of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecanum_wheel">mechanum wheels</a>. For the next two years, I would help design mechanum drive trains for our team (CAD mostly). While cool, unfortunately our teams obsession over the wheels would cause us to lose sight of the arm attachment that would need to sit on to perform the robot's function of removing tubes from the rack for 2007's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rack_'n_Roll">Rack 'n Roll</a> competition.

<h3><b>FIRST Robotics - Sophomore year of High School (2006)</b></h3>
This was the first year our school had a First Robotics team, and our rookie team's entry into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aim_High">Aim High</a> competition. It was and still is a relatively unsophisticated beast of a robot that could pretty much get hit by a train and still work. Fundamentally, its function was to pick up, store, and then shoot foam balls. Sadly this was so long ago (5 years as of writing this... I feel old) I don't specifically remember much of the details about it.

<h3><b>The RCX Lego Programmable Brick - circa 4th grade (~1999)</b></h3>
I may or may not owe approximately all of my engineering and mechanical intuition to Legos. I used to (and most likely still do -- I used this all through high school) love playing with these things. The pinnacle of any Lego set I have ever gotten or probably will ever get has to be the Robotics Invention System. Thank god for my generous and understanding parents for not laughing me out of the room when 4th grader me wanted this $200 kit (I'm not spoiled, they made me work for it, don't worry). Just writing about it makes me want to jump out of this chair, run down to the basement and pull it out and start building. I cannot tell you the hours I spent building and programming (though mostly building) with this thing. More than any other robot on this page, the RCX played a pivotal role in who I am now as a roboticist (if I can even call myself that), as it is endlessly configurable by curious youngsters such as myself.
