#FIRST Robotics

I had the great fortune of being able to participate and be the captain of a FIRST robotics throughout my time at Gilford High School. Here are the robots we built in chronological order.

This was the first year our school had a First Robotics team, and our rookie team's entry into the [Aim High](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aim_High) competition. It was and still is a relatively unsophisticated beast of a robot that could pretty much get hit by a train and still work. Fundamentally, its function was to pick up, store, and then shoot foam balls. Sadly this was so long ago (5 years as of writing this... I feel old) I don't specifically remember much of the details about it.

As is probably evident from that video, this robot represented our team's first foray into the world of [mechanum wheels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecanum_wheel). For the next two years, I would help design mechanum drive trains for our team (CAD mostly). While cool, unfortunately our teams obsession over the wheels would cause us to lose sight of the arm attachment that would need to sit on to perform the robot's function of removing tubes from the rack for 2007's [Rack 'n Roll](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rack_'n_Roll) competition.

This was basically 2007's design, part two. The competition was [Overdrive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRST_Overdrive), which was essentially a race with large balls in the track that optionally accumulate points. As captain, I wanted to steer the team in the direction of "do one thing and do it well" and essentially wanted to design a dragster type robot. However, part of working as a team is accepting other people's ideas even when you don't necessarily agree with them. The team went with mechanum wheels again, and we lost sight of what we were originally trying to do (heard the ball). Still, I tried to make the best of it and designed a completely modular chassis for the wheels, whereby one standard "box" design (included a speed controller, wheel, bearings, pillow blocks, etc) could be iterated four times and bolted together. This saved design time, simplified troubleshooting and made it a breeze to replace parts. Another interesting side effect of this design -- I learned how to properly weld aluminum (there were a TON of joints), which is quite tricky. All in all our team had really perfected the mechanum drive train, so it was not a total loss. Also, this particular year I did not do any nordic skiing for the school, as I contributed much of the programming as well as work on the electrical system of the robot on top of my usual help with the CAD and machining of the drive train.
