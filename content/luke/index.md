<strong>Welcome!</strong> I am a B.S candidate in <a href="http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/">Computer and Systems Engineering</a> at the RPI <a href="http://www.eng.rpi.edu/soe/">School of Engineering</a>. Currently, I also <a href="http://stonelinks.ath.cx/?page_id=243">work</a> for the <a href="http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/hea/">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</a> developing and integrating the hardware and software systems to automate the fabrication of multilayer coatings on the surface of optics for (eventual) use in <a href="http://ixo.gsfc.nasa.gov/">space based observatories</a>. I also do freelance <a href="http://stonelinks.org/websites">website</a> work, both back end programming / administration to front end web design. This summer I'm very excited to be doing work for <a href="http://www.anybots.com/#front">Anybots</a> on their telepresence robots.

The core of my technical interests are deep and varied, but are generally concentrated within the field of robotics and automation. Briefly, I have experience / interest in: microcontroller <a href="http://litec.rpi.edu/">programming</a> and <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">applications</a>, <a href="http://www.solidworks.com/">CAD</a>, <a href="http://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/en_us/products/nx/index.shtml">CAM</a>, automated <a href="http://www.makerbot.com/">manufacturing</a>, systems integration, autonomous and semi-autonomous robotics, robotic locomotion, control, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv5B63HeF1E&amp;feature=related">manipulation</a>, machine vision, artificial intelligence and remote controlled <a href="http://www.gwsus.com/english/english.htm">airplane / helicopter</a> design and operation. I do not consider myself an expert on any single subject, but I have a lot of experience and am always looking for new and interesting technical challenges to both deepen and broaden my skills!

In addition to the above interests, I have always had a very strong connection to computers and computer programming. Languages / environments I currently use or have used are C, C++, <a href="http://www.ni.com/labview/">LabVIEW</a>, Java, Bash, LISP, PHP (some <a href="http://jquery.com/">AJAX</a>), CSS and HTML. I also know how to use MATLAB, Maple, Mathematica, etc. As far as operating environments go, I am a seasoned Windows and <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Linux</a> user and I host this website from my dorm room on a computer that I <a href="http://www.newegg.com/">built</a>.

Outside of the technical world (in my seemingly non-existent free time), I enjoy sailing, running, hiking, traveling, reading, Team Fortress 2, and of course all the <a href="http://photos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-sf2p/v362/57/119/1099020141/n1099020141_30157834_5408.jpg">tom-foolery</a> that comes about when living around friends and fellow engineering students.

Many tell me that I am passionate, disciplined and good natured about what I do. I love trying new things and can often be found doing things just for the challenge and thrill of learning. I consider myself very fortunate to be where I am.
