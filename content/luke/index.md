**Welcome!** I am Lucas Doyle, an engineer, programmer and roboticist. I'm a recent [computer and systems engineering](http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/) graduate from the class of 2012 at the Rensselaer Polytechnic [School of Engineering](http://www.eng.rpi.edu/soe/). For the past three years, I've also [worked]({{wr}}projects/harvard.html) for the [Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics](http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/hea/) where I have developed systems to fabricate experimental X-ray optics for space observatories. Additionally, last summer (2011) I had the phenomenal opportunity to [work]({{wr}}projects/anybots.html) at a Silicon Valley robotics startup called [Anybots](http://www.anybots.com/#front) on their telepresence robots. I also do a lot of paid and non-paid website work, both back end programming / sysadmin tasks and front end web design.

My technical interests are deep and varied, but are generally concentrated within the fields of robotics, simulation and automation. I've worked with microcontrollers, embedded [control systems](http://litec.rpi.edu/), [CAD](http://www.solidworks.com/) / [CAM](http://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/en_us/products/nx/index.shtml) design, automated manufacturing, autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles, robotic telepresence, locomotion, simulation and machine vision. I find robotics as a whole to be the most interesting application of technology in the world, and believe that they will fundamentally change how we live our lives in the future.

In addition to robotics, I've always had a very strong connection to computers and programming. I absolutely love to code! Python is currently my language of choice, but I consider each language I know as a tool suited for a particular role. Languages and environments I'm familiar with are C, C++, Java, LabVIEW, LISP, PHP, CSS and HTML (if you can count those last two as languages). I also have a bit of experience with Javascript, and know how to use MATLAB, Maple, Mathematica, etc. As far as operating systems go, I am a seasoned [GNU/Linux](http://www.debian.org/) user and lover of FOSS. Installing GNU/Linux on all my computers was one of the best decisions I've ever made and really kickstarted my development into a programmer. I used to actually host this website from my dorm room on a server that I [built myself](http://www.newegg.com/) back in high school, and the current iteration is running [in the cloud](http://aws.amazon.com/) on a [framework]({{wr}}projects/stonelinks.html) I wrote myself.

Outside of robotics and programming, I enjoy sailing, running, cycling, a bit of video games (Minecraft and Team Fortress 2) and of course all the [tom-foolery]({{wr}}static/img/me-camera.jpg) that comes about when living with friends and fellow engineers. I've always had a fascination for aviation, aeronautics, economics and (predictably) science fiction. I'm also a published poet. Many tell me that I am passionate, disciplined and good natured about what I do. I take pride in the high standards I hold my work, and don't like to consider myself an expert on any single subject as there is always more to learn. No matter what, I'm always involved in some kind of project to teach myself more. Finally, I consider myself very fortunate to be where I am, and sincerely thank everyone who has helped me get here.
