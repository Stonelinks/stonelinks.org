Hi! I'm Lucas Doyle. I'm an engineer, programmer and roboticist from Gilford, NH. I'm a recent computer and systems engineering graduate from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and I currently work in Tokyo, Japan at an awesome robotics startup called [MUJIN](http://mujin.co.jp)!

<br>

###Background

For the past three years, I've worked for the [Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics](http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/hea/) developing systems to fabricate experimental X-ray optics for space observatories (read about it [here]({{wr}}projects/harvard.html)). Additionally, last summer (2011) I had the phenomenal opportunity to work at a Silicon Valley robotics startup called Anybots on their telepresence robots. While I was there I authored a time saving robot bug and asset tracking system called [Anystats]({{wr}}projects/anybots.html). I was also the leader and head programmer for a collaborative robot planning and simulation framework developed for Boeing during my senior design project at RPI. The robot was designed to improve aircraft design by eliminating the ergonomic constraints for human access to the inside of an aircraft wing (read more about it [here]({{wr}}projects/wingbox.html)). I've been involved in many more projects, check them out on my [projects page]({{wr}}projects/index.html).

###Robotics

My technical interests are generally concentrated within the fields of robotics, simulation and automation. I've worked with microcontrollers, embedded [control systems](http://litec.rpi.edu/), CAD / CAM design, automated manufacturing, autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles, robotic telepresence, locomotion, simulation and machine vision. I find robotics as a whole to be the most interesting application of technology in the world, and believe that they will fundamentally change how we live our lives in the future.

<br>

###Programming

In addition to robotics, I've always had a very strong connection to computers and programming. I absolutely love to code! Python is currently my language of choice, but each language has its benefits and drawbacks. I consider each language I know as a tool suited for a particular role. I'm also well versed in the version control and industry standard development patterns / practices (see you at the scrum!). I am a seasoned [GNU/Linux](http://www.debian.org/) user and lover of FOSS. Installing GNU/Linux on all my computers was one of the best decisions I've ever made and really kickstarted my development as a programmer. I used to actually host this website from my dorm room on a server that I built myself back in high school, but now the it is running [in the cloud](http://aws.amazon.com/) on a [framework]({{wr}}projects/stonelinks.html) I wrote myself.

###Education

Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, B.S., Computer and Systems Engineering

<br>

###Other Interests

Outside of robotics and programming, I enjoy sailing, running, cycling, a bit of video games (Minecraft and Team Fortress 2) and of course all the [tom-foolery]({{wr}}static/img/me-camera.jpg) that comes about when living with friends and fellow engineers. I've always had a fascination for aviation, aeronautics, economics and (predictably) science fiction. I'm also a published poet. I take pride in the high standards I hold myself, and don't like to consider myself an expert on any single subject as there is always more to learn. I also have an inquisitive mind that doesn't easily take things at face value, and I'm constantly inventing, experimenting and learning. I consider myself very fortunate to be where I am, and sincerely thank everyone who has helped me get here.
