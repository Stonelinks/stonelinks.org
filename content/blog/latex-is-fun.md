#Latex is Fun
11/22/2010
I'm using my documentation for work at the Center for Astrophysics as an excuse to learn LaTeX. For those in my generation who have grown up with MS Office or openoffice.org, LaTeX is an ancient typesetting language that can trace its roots back to the legendary [Donald Knuth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) who wrote TeX back in the '70s.
Long story short, it is awesome and as a programmer, really straightforward. Honestly the thing that upsets me the most about LaTeX is that I didn't know it existed back when Matt and I were writing / editing that [137 page paper]({{wr}}static/misc/IED_tech_report_final.pdf) for the IED border patrol robot!
