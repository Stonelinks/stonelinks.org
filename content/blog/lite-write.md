#How I do Word Processing
4/30/2012

A few months ago, I came up with [Lite Write](https://github.com/Stonelinks/Lite-Write) and have been using it in place of a word processor with great success. Like most people who write a lot of code, I'm most comfortable manipulating text in my editor of choice. However, I do a fair amount of writing that needs to be accessible to non programmers, which means my work really can't stay in plain text forever. Lite write is a simple setup (basically a Makefile and some bits of HTML/CSS) that does just that. It has the following features:

- Write everything in markdown
- Produce a PDF of your document
- Produce a standalone HTML version of your document anyone can view online
- Super simple architecture, so its easily to expanded / extended

Over time I've grown very frustrated with traditional word processors (MS Word, OpenOffice, et al.). Google Docs is pretty good, but not well suited for when you're offline or need fine control over formatting. I used LaTeX for awhile because it gave me that control over formatting and produced beautiful looking documents. While awesome for equations, large amounts of text and so many other things, LaTeX's syntax got to be cumbersome (at least in my opinion) for shorter documents. It would distract me from actually getting any writing done.

Enter Lite Write! Markdown is simple enough that I don't even need to think about it, and if I need finer control over formatting I can just write HTML. So far has been great, and hopefully other people will read this, use it and maybe even like it.
