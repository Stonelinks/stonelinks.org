#How I do Word Processing
4/30/2012
A few months ago, I came up with [Lite Write](https://github.com/Stonelinks/Lite-Write) and have been using it in place of a word processor with great success. Like most people who write a lot of code, I'm most comfortable manipulating text in my editor of choice. I do a fair amount of writing that needs to be accessible to non programmers (read: in PDF form), which means my work really can't stay in plain text forever. It is a simple setup (basically a Makefile and some bits of HTML/CSS), but boasts the following features:
- Write everything in markdown
- Produce a PDF of your document
- Produce an HTML version anyone can view online
- Super simple, so its easily to expanded / extended
Over time I've grown very frustrated with traditional word processors (MS Word, OpenOffice, et al.). Google Docs is pretty good, but not well suited for when you're offline. I used LaTeX for awhile because it gave me more control over formatting and produced beautiful looking documents. While awesome for equations, large amounts of text and many other things, LaTeX's syntax got to be cumbersome for shorter documents. It would distract me from actually getting any writing done.
Enter Lite Write! It has been great, and hopefully other people will read this and find it useful.
