#The Battlebot

***This is old. Look at posts if you want to see current versions of my projects. These pages are from a now defunct RPI Battlebots Club website. I've kept a few pages because I think we actually come up with a pretty good design. ***

# Introducing our Robot!

We are proud to announce the genesis of our first robot design ever! After much brainstorming and deliberation, this yet-to-be-named hybrid bar spinner design has been cooked up. The effectiveness and simplicity of such a design will offer our rookie team a good starting point for the future, but at the same time not be a boring or overly simplistic [box on wheels.](http://i-5autogroup.com/images/pics/pro_91_1.jpg).

##The Bar Spinner

Almost all the damage done in combat robotics is through the massive transfer of kinetic energy from one robot to another. The easiest way to accomplish this is to collide a large, fast moving mass with an enemy robot. To that end, we have decided to develop a full body spinner / bar spinner hybrid design. The weapon implementation will be similar to that of [Son of Whyachi](http://www.teamwhyachi.com/sow.htm).

However, it will be different in that the hammers on the end of our bars will extend around a portion of the circumference of our bot and actually be in contact with the sides of the bot through roller bearings or something similar. This, combined with the large surface area of each hammer, will help distribute the force of any impact to the entirety of the robots frame. We are hoping to power the weapon with the phenomenal 4.5 horsepower [S28-400 MagMotor.](http://www.robotmarketplace.com/products/MAG-S28-400.html) For redundancy and mechanical simplicity, we have chosen to independently drive the four wheels of the robot. Each wheel system will consist of [2.5" CIM motors](http://www.trossenrobotics.com/store/p/5142-FIRST-CIM-Motor.aspx), [AndyMark Toughbox Nano](http://store.andymark.biz/am-0553.html) gearboxes, custom pillow blocks, bearings, and other assorted hardware.
