#Battlebot CAD Repository

<h3>Directory Snapshot</h3>
Below should be a collapsible tree of files. This is a snapshot of all the CAD files located on Luke's Computer.

For those who just want to check things out, I suggest you open up the .STEP file in the editor of your choice. Otherwise, unless you want to look at a specific part, download the most recent .zip backup containing everything.

Don't hesitate to <a href="mailto: lucas.p.doyle@gmail.com">email me</a> with any questions or problems with anything you see here. If you are having problems viewing the tree, then you are probably using internet explorer and should download a <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">better browser</a>! Team members should also check out the readme!
