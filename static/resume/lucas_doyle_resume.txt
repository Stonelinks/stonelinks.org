Education
==============================================

Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
Troy, NY, Fall 2008 - Spring 2012
B.S., Computer and Systems Engineering, GPA of 3.10

Gilford High School
Gilford, NH, Fall 2004 - Spring 2008
GPA of 4.00

Professional
==============================================

MUJIN Inc.
Software engineer
Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan, Fall 2012 - Present
Designed and implemented the web interface to MUJIN's revolutionary   
industrial robotics motion planning software. Wrote the javascript    
clent library that uses MUJIN's RESTful API to power its products. 

Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
Automations Programmer / Engineer
Cambridge, MA, Summer 2009 - Present
Designed, constructed and programmed an experimental X-ray optic      
production facility. Wrote intuitive software to simplify             
fabrication of X-ray optics in multiple production scenarios.         
Designed sample manipulation hardware and a high strength production  
chamber mount using CAD. Saved time and lowered costs by developing   
a more efficient shutter controller now used on all production        
chambers in the lab. Worked closely with physicists, component        
vendors, machinists and other key stakeholders to complete project    
on time. Supervised a high school student to characterize potential   
optic substrates with a high precision 3D profilemeter. 

Anybots Inc.
Robotics Intern
Mountain View, CA, Summer 2011
Solely designed and authored Anystats, a tool to statistically        
track, analyze and prioritize events from thousands of logs from a    
fleet of telepresence robots. Saved time by cross referencing event   
data with customer information and known bugs to dispatch             
engineering and support teams effectively. Also implemented UI        
features for touchscreen on forehead of robot, namely a dashboard to  
display internal robot device status and connectivity, as well as a   
call screen to allow users to answer or deny calls made to their      
telepresence robot. 

Notable Projects and Open Source
==============================================

Boeing Robotic Wingbox
Team Leader and Lead Programmer
Troy, NY, Spring 2012
 - Led a capstone team of engineering students to design a simulator     
   for an intra-wing robot to operate inside an aircraft. 
 - Worked closely with Boeing to fulfill requirements for assembly and   
   maintenance roles of operation. 
 - Implemented client / server architecture to distribute computation    
   effectively and allow collaborative robot use. 
 - Designed and implemented a 3D interface with joystick integration to  
   allow user to easily modify robot state. 
 - Wrote highly concurrent, high-performance server to control robot     
   hardware, recognize object locations with OpenCV and plan          
   kinematic trajectories to avoid collisions. 

DaBuzz Market Sentiment Analyzer
Team Member
Troy, NY, Spring 2012
 - Designed and implemented web crawler and scraper to analyze           
   financial news sources and gauge stock market sentiment. 
 - Assisted in implementation and training of classifier using Python    
   Natural Language Toolkit. 
 - Gave presentations and poster sessions to the RPI Community about     
   DaBuzz and the Rensselaer Center for Open Source Software.
