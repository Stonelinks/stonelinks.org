Education
==============================================

Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
Troy NY, Fall 2008 - Spring 2012
B.S., Computer and Systems Engineering, GPA of 3.10

Gilford High School
Gilford NH, Fall 2004 - Spring 2008
GPA of 4.00


Professional Experience
==============================================

Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
Automations Programmer / Engineer, Cambridge MA, Summer 2009 - Present
Designed, constructed and programmed an experimental X-ray optic
production facility. Wrote intuitive software to simplify fabrication of X-ray
optics in multiple production scenarios. Designed sample manipulation
hardware and a high strength production chamber mount using CAD.
Saved time and lowered costs by developing a more efficient shutter
controller now used on all production chambers in the lab. Worked closely
with physicists, component vendors, machinists and other key stakeholders
to complete project on time. Supervised a high school student to
characterize potential optic substrates with a high precision 3D
profilemeter.


Anybots, Inc.
Robotics Intern, Mountain View CA, Summer 2011
Solely designed and authored Anystats, a tool to statistically track,
analyze and prioritize events from thousands of logs from a fleet of
telepresence robots. Saved time by cross referencing event data with
customer information and known bugs to dispatch engineering and support
teams effectively. Also implemented UI features for touchscreen on
forehead of robot, namely a dashboard to display internal robot device
status and connectivity, as well as a call screen to allow users to answer
or deny calls made to their telepresence robot.


Notable Projects and Open Source
==============================================

Boeing Robotic Wingbox
Team Leader and Lead Programmer, Troy NY, Spring 2012
Led a capstone team of engineering students to design a simulator for an
intra-wing robot to operate inside an aircraft. Worked closely with Boeing
to fulfill requirements for assembly and maintenance roles of operation.
Implemented client / server architecture to distribute computation
effectively and allow collaborative robot use. Designed and implemented a
3D interface with joystick integration to allow user to easily modify robot
state. Wrote highly concurrent, high-performance server to control robot
hardware, recognize object locations with OpenCV and plan kinematic
trajectories to avoid collisions.

DaBuzz Market Sentiment Analyzer
Team Member, Troy NY, Spring 2012
Designed and implemented web crawler and scraper to analyze financial
news sources and gauge stock market sentiment. Assisted in
implementation and training of classifier using Python Natural Language
Toolkit. Gave presentations and poster sessions to the RPI Community
about DaBuzz and the Rensselaer Center for Open Source Software.


Key Technical Skills
